## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Computer :desktop_computer: programmer, Amateur SysAdmin :gear: and PC Hardware Hobbyist :wrench:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bringing old code into the future.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, prompt engineering, COM+ (aka Distributed COM) and too many other things to list
- âš¡ Fun habit: Always keep a tutorial up on a separate virtual desktop. On Windows at the time of this writing Win+CTRL+D creates a new desktop and Win+CTRL+RightArrow navigates to it.
